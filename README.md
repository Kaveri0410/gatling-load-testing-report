## 🎯 Project Objective

To perform advanced load testing on a web application using **Gatling** and analyze system performance under simulated heavy user load conditions.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Gatling (Scala-based load testing tool)
- Java JDK
- Scala
- HTML Reports (Generated by Gatling)

---

## 🌐 Target Application Details

- **Base URL:** https://reqres.in  
- **Endpoint Tested:** `/api/users?page=2`  
- **Request Type:** HTTP GET  

---

## 📊 Test Scenario

- Simulated **100 concurrent users**
- Ramp-up Time: **30 seconds**
- Each virtual user sends an HTTP GET request to the target endpoint
- Performance monitored during full load execution

---

## 📝 Test Script Overview

The load test was developed using **Gatling DSL in Scala**.  
The script simulates multiple virtual users accessing the API simultaneously to evaluate system performance under heavy traffic conditions.

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics Analyzed

- Minimum Response Time  
- Maximum Response Time  
- Average Response Time  
- Requests per Second  
- Successful vs Failed Requests  
- Load Distribution Over Time  

---

## ✅ Results Summary

- The system handled 100 concurrent users successfully.
- No request failures were observed.
- Response times remained stable throughout the test.
- The application maintained consistent performance under simulated heavy load.

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

The load testing exercise confirms that the tested application performs reliably under simulated heavy user load conditions.  
The system maintained stable response times and achieved a **100% success rate without errors**, demonstrating readiness for production-level traffic scenarios.
